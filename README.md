## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js , a node global package  and installed in your environement. Also download postgres database from *[here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)*.

## Getting started: 
### 1.Clone this Repository
```
   git clone https://github.com/Salsabeel95/Storefront-Backend-project.git
   cd 'Storefront Backend project'
```
### 2.Install project dependencies

```
  npm install
```
### 3.Project configration
>  Note: Simply No configrations needed to provide. Configration will be used automatically from `src/utilities/config.ts` file, *So make sure to check it first*.

#### Or you can create your own `.env` file in the root directory with variables:
* SERVER_PORT
* POSTGRES_PORT
* POSTGRES_HOST
* POSTGRES_DB
* POSTGRES_DB_TEST
* POSTGRES_USER
* POSTGRES_PASSWORD
* ENV
* CRYPT_PASSWORD
* SALT_ROUNDS
* TOKEN_SECRET 

#### 3.1 Create databases and db user which are mentioned above using:
In the Windows Command Prompt, run the command:
```
psql â€“U postgres
```
*Enter default user password when prompted.
*Make a database user 
```
create user [user name] with encrypted password '[your password]';
grant all privileges on database [database name] to [user name];
```
> Note: Database defualt port is 5432 but you can change it in `src/utilities/config.ts`. For more details about postgres check [this](https://linuxhint.com/connect-to-postgresql-database-command-line-windows/)

### 4.Setting up database tables and structure with migration in development enviroment

```
  npm run dev:up
```
### 5.Build and watch production 

```
  npm run watch
```
### Or build and start production enviroment

```
  npm start
```
  ##### Server will run on 5200 port, you should see this after starting project in terminal/cmd
```
  server started at localhost:5200
```
### 5.Test project 
This will run db and server tests in `src/tests`
```
  npm test
```
> This command includes building project and setting up database tables and structure with migration for test

## Now you can run the project but if you need you can also:
### Setting up database tables and structure with migration for test enviroment

```
  npm run up
```
### Reset all database settings(tables and structure) with migration in development enviroment

```
  npm run dev:reset
```
### Reset all database settings(tables and structure) with migration for test enviroment

```
  npm run reset
```
### Making a migration with its name iin src/migration folder

```
  npx db-migrate create [migration name] --sql-file
```
